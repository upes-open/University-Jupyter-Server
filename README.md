# University-Jupyter-Server

Various cloud services provide online Jupyter notebook servers such
 as Google colab, Kaggle etc. But these services have various
 restriction such as the number of training hours and processing
 power available. Thus, due to such uncertainties these services
 cannot be used to train and research models that require 12+ hours.
 At the same time, we have machines at Machine Intelligence Research
 Centre (MIRC) which are underutilized and idle. Hosting a
 JupyterHubs service on these machines would provide a remote
 development environment to work on where one could simply provide
 his credentials and will be able to leverage these state-of-the-art
 GPUs free from restrictions thus promoting research and development
 in the field of ML/AI. These environments allow the machines to be
 used by multiple users at the same time. Further we could create
specific environment and simply share the notebook link eliminating
the tedious process of installing large libraries that students
face during start of lab sessions.
